Im making a "search engine" and here are the details
I will make it brief...
It is a toy right now, I am making it to possibly 
contribute to a actual search engine later. If you
want to scrape the inside of your eyes with a knife,
here is the source code.
I have a hell of a lot of results, but thats useless
Within the next day I am going to make the text on
the page searchable. It will see if your search exactly
matches any of the text on a page it has in the db.
It will also display this text in the description
when you search for it. 
<center>How to get ranked</center>
Well, I havnt wrote a ranking system yet. This is the
only hard part ;) Also, the reason all other engines 
have failed in the past. I figure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80% 20%</a>
right? As of right now, I strip the title from the HTML
on your page, the keywords meta off your page, and
the discription meta off your page. They are all 
searchable, but not much else can be said.
