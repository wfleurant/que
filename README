	Que es hasta

Im making a "search engine" and here are the details
I will make it brief...
It is a toy right now, I am making it to possibly 
contribute to a actual search engine later. If you
want to scrape the inside of your eyes with a knife,
here is the source code.
I have a hell of a lot of results, but thats useless
Within the next day I am going to make the text on
the page searchable. It will see if your search exactly
matches any of the text on a page it has in the db.
It will also display this text in the description
when you search for it.

	How to get ranked

Well, I havnt wrote a ranking system yet. This is the
only hard part ;) Also, the reason all other engines 
have failed in the past. I figure, 80% 20% 
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle **
right? As of right now, I strip the title from the HTML
on your page, the keywords meta off your page, and
the discription meta off your page. They are all 
searchable, but not much else can be said. 

	Whats to be done

- [x] Add all links on a page to db
- [x] Make Title, Keywords, and url searchable
- [x] Get Live example
- [x] Open Source it!
- [ ] Check if links are Hype or not and flag them
- [ ] Searchable Text
- [ ] Add a Ranking system
- [ ] Searchable Source code
- [ ] Searchable Images

	How to run a copy
I am not sure how its gonna work for you, but here
is how it worked for me. I run Arch Linux, MariaDB,
phpmyadmin, and python3. Basically, 
1. Git clone http://gitboria.com/Nathanial/que.git
2. open up phpmyadmin 
3. make a new database with all the defaults
4. browse to it, go to the Import tab at the top
5. Click Browse and select the data.sql 
6. You should have a table named search with a couple
   columns.
7. Add your credentials to poser.py and search.php
8. Make it better
9. $$$
10. Credit me
